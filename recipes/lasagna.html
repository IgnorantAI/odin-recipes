You can find tons of variations and I donâ€™t claim to have the most original ones but itâ€™s very good and appreciated also by the most traditional friends I have. I cook this at least once every other week and itâ€™s useful because itâ€™s main and only course for my dinner and everyone in my family is satisfied
