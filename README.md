# odin-recipes
First project for a brutally ugly website (probably mentioning only a few recipes)

Feel free to add any further typical recipe from your country!

It turns out I am supposed to mention what I am capable of at the moment of this first file, like a diary if you will.
Well, not much to be honest... I am still getting used to the UK keyboard layout (it`s more practical for coding compared to the italian one) and I can barely write headers with <"h1"> and such. Also, no CSS whatsoever at this point.

Wish me luck!
