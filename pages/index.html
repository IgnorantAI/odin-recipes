    <h1> Recipes from the world</h1>
    <h2>The best start : Lasagne</h2>
    <p>
        It’s time to make pleased all my friends around the world. So, here you are for you the most known, cooked, posted and delicious Italian recipe: lasagna bolognese.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have to admit that everywhere I went I found people that could cook this delicious dish, one country one taste. You can find tons of variations and I don’t claim to have the most original ones but it’s very good and appreciated also by the most traditional friends I have. I cook this at least once every other week and it’s useful because it’s main and only course for my dinner and everyone in my family is satisfied 
    </p>

    <p>
        Not difficult to make, you need only time and patience: it’s not the dish you can prepare in 30 minutes when you’re back at home from the office with hungry husband and crying children. Let’s think in cooking all steps in advance and compose the lasagna 1 hr before your friends ring at the door. So, take note and good luck!
